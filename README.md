## Group 3 (TranSentCut)
We edited train.py so that it can read text from eval.txt and append to the ORCHID dataset

So there will be two seperate files
1. train.py --> normal train.py for training ORCHID dataset
2. train_eval.py --> edited version of train.py for trainning ORCHID datast + eval.txt

article.txt is also included in this reporitory
It is a text file containing the data from serveral news articles, which is seperated into sentences by hand.

The article.txt can be used to test both of our models.
